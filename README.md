Heart diseases have become a major concern to deal with as studies show that the number of deaths due to heart diseases have increased significantly over the past few decades in India, in fact it has become the leading cause of death in India even world.

A study shows that from 1990 to 2021 the death rate due to heart diseases have increased around 40 per cent from 150 to 220 deaths per one lakh population in India.

Thus preventing Heart diseases has become more than necessary. Good data-driven systems for predicting heart diseases can improve the entire research and prevention process, making sure that more people can live healthy lives. This is where Machine Learning comes into play. Machine Learning helps in predicting the Heart diseases, and the predictions made are quite accurate.

This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to
this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.

1 id: patient identification number
2 ccf: social security number (I replaced this with a dummy value of 0)
3 age: age in years
4 sex: sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
5 painloc: chest pain location (1 = substernal; 0 = otherwise)
6 painexer (1 = provoked by exertion; 0 = otherwise)
